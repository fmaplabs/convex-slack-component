# Publishing

In order for other people to install and use this component, you can publish the
package to npm.

You will first need to have an npmjs account with permissions to push to your
package name.

If this is your first time, here are the recommended steps:

1. Ensure the package.json "name" matches what you want it to be called. It
   should either be like `my-package` or `@my-org/my-package`. If it's the
   latter, ensure you have an npmjs account with permissions to push to
   `my-org`.
2. `pnpm login` to login to npmjs.
3. `pnpm run build:clean` to clean your `/dist` directory.
4. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` to install the dependencies with the
   versions specified in `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
5. `pnpm run build` to build the package fresh.
6. (Optional) `pnpm run typecheck` to typecheck the package.
7. (Optional) `pnpm run lint` to lint the package.
8. (Optional) `pnpm run test` to test the package.
9. (Optional) `pnpm pack` will create a .tgz file of the package. You can then
   try installing it in another project with
   `pnpm add ./path/to/your-package.tgz` to sanity check that it works as
   expected. You can remove the .tgz file after.
10. `pnpm publish --access public --no-git-checks` to publish the package to npm.
11. `git tag v0.1.0` to tag the new version.
12. `git push --follow-tags` to push the tags to the repository. This way, other
    contributors can always see what code was published with each version.
    Running `pnpm version ...` will create these tags and commits automatically.

After the initial publish, you can use the release scripts documented below,
which will do steps 3-12 automatically (except the sanity check in step 9).

## Package scripts for releasing

In package.json, there are some scripts that are useful for doing releases.

- `preversion` runs
  `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm run build:clean && pnpm run test && pnpm run lint && pnpm run typecheck`
  before marking a new version. A fresh build happens via `build:clean` inside
  this step.
- `version` updates the CHANGELOG (opening it in vim, then saving it) before
  committing the new version.

These are not required and can be modified or removed if desired. They will all
be run automatically when using one of the deployment commands.

## Deploying a new alpha version

```sh
pnpm run alpha
```

This will create a prerelease version with an `@alpha` tag. It will then publish
the package to npm and push the code and new tag. Users can install the package
with `pnpm add @your-package@alpha`.

## Deploying a new release version

```sh
pnpm run release
```

This will create a patch version and publish as `latest`. It will then publish
the package to npm and push the code and new tag. To publish a new minor or
major version, you can run the commands manually:

```sh
pnpm version minor # or major
pnpm publish --no-git-checks
git push --follow-tags
```

## Building a one-off package

```sh
pnpm run build:clean
pnpm run build
pnpm pack
```

You can then provide the .tgz file to others to install via
`pnpm add ./path/to/your-package.tgz`.
